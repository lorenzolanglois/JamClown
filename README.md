# JamClown
First NDS project, made in a weekend for a game jam. The themes were *Circus* and *Industrial*. Made using [libnds](https://libnds.devkitpro.org/).

You are in an old circus transformed into a cannon factory, you have to find the penguin among the cannons. Every correct guess gives you a point, and every incorrect guess removes one.<br>
You have 1 minute to make the highest score possible.

## Notes
### Code
Some leftover code has been removed since the game jam, and some spelling mistakes in the files/variables have been corrected, but the game itself is the exact same as when it was first finished.

### Sounds
I had problems with playing the sounds in-game, this is not how it's supposed to sounds like. I didn't fix it by lack of time during the jam, this is also the reason why I didn't bother to add background music.

### Assets
All the 3d models, textures and sounds are made by me. Original obj files are in the *assets/* folder and original textures are in the *graphics/* folder.<br>
The sounds however are already ready as bin files in the *data/* folder.
